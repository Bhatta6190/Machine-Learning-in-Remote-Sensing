# Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

This repository hosts tools and resources for application of "Machine Learning" to the remote sensing data to generate qualitative and quantitative data products. The tools included will cover tasks related to data cleaning, data analysis, feature extraction, feature engineering, and outcome modeling in various remote sesning data modality including but not limited to multispectral, hyperspectral, lidar and so on. The reposistory will be updated regularly as per the work done and the required resources will be added with each update.

Suggestions and contributions to improve the repository quality will be higly appreciated.
