# Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

This repository provides tools and resources for applying machine learning to remote sensing data, enabling the generation of qualitative and quantitative data products. It covers tasks such as data cleaning, analysis, feature extraction, feature engineering, and outcome modeling across various remote sensing modalities, including multispectral, hyperspectral, and lidar data. The repository will be updated regularly with new tools and resources.

Suggestions and contributions are highly appreciated.
